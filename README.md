# üö≤ Bike Demand Prediction using LSTM

This project predicts the hourly demand for rental bikes in urban areas using historical and real-time data, including weather conditions and time-related features. The goal is to ensure a stable supply of rental bikes to minimize user waiting time and improve city mobility.

## üìå Problem Statement

Bike-sharing systems must provide bikes on time and in the right quantity. This project uses a deep learning model (LSTM) to predict the hourly bike count needed to meet demand efficiently.

## üß† ML Model

We used a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** model, ideal for time-series forecasting, trained on features like:
- Hour of the day
- Weather conditions
- Working day / Holiday
- Temperature, humidity, windspeed


## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Santhosh944/bike-demand-prediction.git
   cd bike-demand-prediction
2. Install dependencies:

5.Visit: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Results
The model achieved promising accuracy with low MAE and RMSE. Visualizations showed close alignment between actual and predicted bike demand.
